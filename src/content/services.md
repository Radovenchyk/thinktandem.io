Your organization has a great team working on important projects, but nothing seems to be getting done fast enough. Deadlines are passing and budgets are being surpassed. Meanwhile, customers and other stakeholders are getting frustrated.

You're not alone. Working with software teams, we've seen many symptoms of inefficient development:

- Features are consistently underestimated
- When features are completed, it takes many release cycles to work out all their bugs
- Releases are infrequent and difficult to deploy
- It feels like your project is just "churning" on bugs and failing to produce value

Fortunately, there are ways we can help.
