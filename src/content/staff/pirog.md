Mike is a senior DevOps consultant with over a decade of experience finding better ways to make and deliver web applications. Unlike many engineers, Mike has the rare ability to recognize business value as the foremost concern in determining the solution to any software problem.

A prolific open source contributor, Mike is the architect behind Kalabox, a Docker-powered tool for local development and continuous integration.

Away from the monitor, Mike is often found deep in conversation arguing the merits of Gilded Age grooming practices and fleshing out his concept for a Russian-language Weezer coverband.
