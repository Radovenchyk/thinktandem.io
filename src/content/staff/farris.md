Geoff is a senior developer with over 20 years of programming experience.
This gives him perspective on both how things were and how things are and more importantly gives him the
foundation to chase the latest and greatest technology.

Geoff is an open source contributor to Backdrop CMS, Backdrop Drush
extension, Drupal, Kalabox and others.

Away from the monitor, Geoff can be found playing video games, running, and playing in
bands such as The Royal We and the_understatements.
