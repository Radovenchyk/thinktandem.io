Alec is a digital solutions consultant who helps organization get more value from their software projects. His digital agency background gave Alec the opportunity to experience a variety of strategies for managing web application projects and made him an ardent student of lean business development, agile project management, and continuous delivery methodologies.

When he's not collecting new tools and tricks of the trade, you can find him either running or hiking on the trails around the San Francisco East Bay, observing local birdlife, and making the odd batch of sauerkraut.
