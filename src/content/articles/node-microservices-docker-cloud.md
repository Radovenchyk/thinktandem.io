If you're read my previous article introducing the idea of microservices and discussing why NodeJS and Docker are ideal tools to implement microservices with, then you're probably hungry for some action!

The following instructions take you through the basic steps necessary to create your first NodeJS app and host it on Docker Cloud.

## 1. Setup

In 2016, setting up your local computer to create apps with NodeJS and Docker is easier than ever before. Simply...

- [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker)
- [Install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
- [Create a Docker ID on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com)

## 2. Create Your Microservice

For demonstration purposes, our first Microservice will just be a tiny NodeJS app

## 3. Add a Dockerfile

## 4. Deploy to Docker Hub

## 5. Deploy to Docker Cloud

## 6. Basic Scaling on Docker Cloud
