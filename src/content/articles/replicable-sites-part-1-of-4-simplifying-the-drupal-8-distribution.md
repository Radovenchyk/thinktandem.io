Prelude
--------

The case study


Make this as simple as possible
--------------------------------

Talk about forking drupal composer, and create a composer only base solution with the caveat below:


#### Why are you still using a .make file?

Talk about why using a make file is silly and use node + composr instead.

#### Replicable scripts

Talk about destroying and reusing the scripts with the one I made.


Base parts of the profile
--------------------------

Talk about the .install. the .info.yml, the .profile


Theme components
----------------

Talk about how this is optional and how we are doing this for the use case.  Talk about how we split the theme and bootstarp components to its own githubs


Config
------

Talk about the config setup with the script I made, etc.


Conclusion
----------

Talk again about how simple this all is and in the next step we talk about how we are designing this with the 4 modules, etc.
