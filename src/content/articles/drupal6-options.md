Overview
-------------------

According to the [Usage statistics for Drupal core](https://www.drupal.org/project/usage/drupal), there are still roughly 40,000 sites on Drupal.  This number is most likely low since this chart only shows sites that have the update status module enabled.  That being said, there could still be well over 100,000 sites on Drupal 6 at the time of this article.  

You may not know that Drupal 6 reached end of life on February 24th, 2016.  What this means is that your site is no longer supported by the core community.  Your site will no longer receive security updates and support requests will no longer be answered on [drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org).  On top of this, your [PHP versions](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) may unsupported as well.  This all sounds like a lot, but you have options.  Let's go over what you can possibly do to get your site up to date and on track.

Drupal 6 Long Term Support
------------------

There are a [few companies](https://www.drupal.org/project/d6lts) that are currently maintaining Drupal 6 core and some contrib modules on their own.  This in turns helps us keep your [Drupal 6 site going via Long Term Support](https://thinktandem.io/blog/2019/01/22/drupal-6-lts-php-7-platform-sh/).  So what does that mean for you and your site?

1. We can use the Drupal 6 LTS core and contrib modules to keep your site secure.
2. We can update your site to a modern PHP version like 7.1.
3. This will buy you some time possibly until about 2022. 

This is a great option if you still need to utilize your current Drupal 6 site.  Clients who choose this route are still adding content and just don't have the budget to move off of Drupal 6.

Upgrade to Drupal 8
-----------------

Drupal 8 migrations is one of our specialties.  We have [written numerous technical blog articles](https://thinktandem.io/blog/) on Drupal 8 migrations.  Drupal 8 is a vastly different CMS than its predecessors.  Its scalability, extensibility, and user experience is leaps and bounds over other CMS's.  Why would you want to go with Drupal 8?

1. You need a custom solution to meet your marketing needs.
2. You need plug and play with many 3rd party apps and services.
3. Need a powerful CMS to handle your wide variety of content customizations.

This option can be one of the more costly options for clients.  Usually during a Drupal 8 migration, the site is re-themed as well.  The good news is that once you get to Drupal 8, there is [no need to worry about future versions](https://dri.es/plan-for-drupal-9) of Drupal.  The underlying framework changed and now major verison upgrades are no big deal. 

Migrate to another CMS
----------------------

It does happen that your Drupal 6 site was built in a way that left a sour taste in your mouth.  We have seen this form time to time and we understand.  [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) is another viable option to migrate your Drupal 6 site to.  Why would you go with WordPress over Drupal?

1. Drag and drop editorial experience with plugins like [Elementor](https://elementor.com/).
2. Simple content editorial needs.
3. Your needs are cost prohibitive.

WordPress is an easy to build solution for smaller to medium sized businesses.  This is why WordPress powers a third of the Internet currently.  WordPress is a clear choice if you have smaller budgets and do not need on going development help.  

Archive the site as static webpages
------------------

Sometimes you just need the content of your site to remain as is forever.  This is common in smaller non-profits and higher education departments.  You have a few choices here as well.  You can just copy the HTML of the site and put it on another server.  You can also migrate the content to a static site builder like [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/).  There are also free hosting providers like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for static sites.  Why go with this option?

1. You just need to archive the content for your organization.
2. You you won't be updating the content very much or at all.
3. The site still has value but you no longer have budget for it.

This is typically a low cost option depending on if you go with a static site generator or not.  Some people use this option to still use their 20 year old domain to drive traffic to a newer organization.  

Conclusion
-----------

All hope is not lost for your Drupal 6 site.  There are still many options for your organization to continue with whatever marketing goals your site may need.  [Contact Us](https://thinktandem.io/contact/) today to talk about what options are best for your Drupal 6 site.
