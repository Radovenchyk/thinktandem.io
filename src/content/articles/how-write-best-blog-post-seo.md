Before diving it, I strongly recommend you have either a paid [ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com), [Moz](https://moz.com/), or [SEMrush](https://www.semrush.com/) account.  They are crucial for any writing SEO efforts.

The tool I use mainly when writing SEO articles is ahrefs. You can apply what is similar in Moz or SEMrush to the examples below.  Also, there are still a plethora of free SEO tools that offer help with keyword planning, content planning, seo technical writing, etc.

Prerequisite 
-------

You will need to install the tool bar for the SEO platform of your choice.  This allows us to easily search [Google](https://www.google.com/) for SEO friendly content based on our research.  As I mentioned previously, the SEO tool of choice for me is ahrefs.  Like other SEO tools, ahrefs [has a chrome extension](https://ahrefs.com/seo-toolbar) that requires no configuration.

Once you have the toolbar installed, head over to Google and type any search.  I searched for the infamous quote "Shampoo is better" and the results looked like this:

As you can see, there are numerous indicators as to why this SEO friendly content ranks higher than others.  The main factors I usually look at is the DR (Domain Rating) number.  Here is a great blog post on what [ahrefs Domain Rating](https://ahrefs.com/blog/domain-rating/) is and how to understand the values.      

Setup & Planning
-------

In this next section, I am going to go over a very crucial step in writing SEO superior posts.  Most of us need to do this next step because we cannot afford to pay a SEO content writer for every blog post we write.  This step does take some time and effort.  I usually spend a couple hours on this step to preapre for the post before I even began a writing sample.

### Picking Keywords

At the start, you generally want to pick three to four keywords that you want to base your blog post around.  You will do the research on these keywords in a later step.  However, just think of the topiv you are about to write and pick your keywords from this.

### Planning the Title

Having a proper is title is one of the biggest steps in writing a technically proficient blog post.  Typically the title of our blog post is what is also used in your meta tags and in the slug of the blog post's URL.  So taking the time to plan out a good title is extremely important.

Another suggestion is to use some [title modifiers](https://www.adamriemer.me/50-modifiers-boost-seo-drive-sales/) as well.  You can tell by the title of this article I used this advice as well.  Don't go too crazy with the modifiers as you need to keep the title about 50-60 characters long.

### Keyword Planning

So now begins the real heavy lifting part in our SEO blog post writing efforts.  This is where you will need a paid ahrefs account to get the most of this step.  

To begin, we will take each of our keywords and plug them into the [ahrefs Keyword Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer).  I found it easier to use one keyword at a time as it just seem quicker to find long tail results.  

We are doing two things here when using the Keyword Explorer.  First, we are trying to increase the saturation of our main keywords by resuing them in a more clever way.  Second, we are also hitting less competitve search terms that can bring in more traffic for our SEO efforts.  I [found this article on long tail keywords](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/definition-long-tail-keyword-100-words-sr) to be the best explanation of this effort.

Once you have the result from the Keyword Explorer, you need to di the following:

1. Click on the All link under keyword ideas on the left.
2. Use the KD filter and set it from 0 to 30.  

Your results should look something like this:

Make sure you are sorting by volume as well.  We want to be picking keywords that have the best SEO results with the lowest competition.  The KD metric is the [Keyword Difficulty](https://ahrefs.com/keyword-difficulty) factor.  The higher the number, the harder it is to rank SEO wise for that keyword.
