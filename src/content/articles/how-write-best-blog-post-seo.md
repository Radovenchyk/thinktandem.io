Before diving in, I strongly recommend you have either a paid [ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com), [Moz](https://moz.com/), or [SEMrush](https://www.semrush.com/) account.  They are crucial for any SEO writing efforts.

The tool I use mainly when writing SEO articles is ahrefs. You can apply what is similar in Moz or SEMrush to the examples below.  Also, there are still a plethora of free SEO tools that offer help with keyword planning, content planning, SEO technical writing, etc.

Prerequisite
-------

You will need to install the toolbar for the SEO platform of your choice.  This allows us to easily search [Google](https://www.google.com/) for metrics on SEO friendly content during our research.  As I mentioned previously, the SEO tool of choice for me is ahrefs.  Like other SEO tools, ahrefs [has a chrome extension](https://ahrefs.com/seo-toolbar) that requires no configuration.

Once you have the toolbar installed, head over to Google and type any search.  I searched for the infamous quote "Shampoo is better" and the results looked like this:

<img src="images/articles/writing-best-seo-post/ahrefs-toolbar-shampoo.jpg" alt="ahrefs Google search toolbar example">

As you can see, there are numerous indicators as to why this SEO friendly content ranks higher than others.  The main factor I usually look at during my research is the DR (Domain Rating) number.  Here is a great blog post on what the [ahrefs Domain Rating](https://ahrefs.com/blog/domain-rating/) is and how to understand the values.

Setup & Planning
-------

In this next section, I am going to go over a very crucial step in writing SEO superior posts.  Most of us need to do this next step because we cannot afford to pay a SEO content writer for every blog post we write.  This step does take a decent amount of time and effort.  I usually spend a couple hours on this step to prepare for the post before I even began writing any content.  That seems like a lot of time, but the effort can pay dividends in the end if done properly.

### Picking Keywords

At the start, you generally want to pick three to four keywords that you want to base your blog post around.  You will do the research on these keywords in a later step.  However, just think of the topic you are about to write and pick your keywords from this.  Try not to worry too much about how these keywords may rank.  You can adjust the keyword phrases once you have your do your research.

### Planning the Title

Having a proper title is one of the biggest steps in writing a technically proficient blog post.  Typically the title of our blog post is what is also used in your meta tags and in the slug of the blog post's URL.  There are some ranking factors around those two items, so taking the time to plan out a good title is extremely important.

Another suggestion is to use some [title modifiers](https://www.adamriemer.me/50-modifiers-boost-seo-drive-sales/) as well.  You can tell by the title of this article I used this advice as well.  Don't go too crazy with the modifiers as you need to keep the title about 50-60 characters long.  I believe they may be changing this to a slightly higher number (or have), but for now just go with the old rule of thumb.

### Keyword Planning

**Keyword Explorer**

So now begins the real heavy lifting part in our SEO blog post writing efforts.  This is where you will need a paid ahrefs account to get the most of the followings steps.  If you don't have the budget for a paid tool like ahrefs or Moz, it isn't as effective in the end.  There are articles out there, [like this one](https://www.highervisibility.com/blog/top-5-free-keyword-research-tools/), that show you some free resources to use.  Go through my steps below and see if these free tools offer a similar experience if need be.

To begin, we will take each of our keywords and plug them into the [ahrefs Keyword Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer).  I found it easier to use one keyword at a time as it just seem quicker to find long tail results.

We are doing two things here when using the Keyword Explorer.  First, you are trying to increase the saturation of your main keywords by reusing them in a more clever way.  Second, you are also hitting less competitive search terms that can bring in more traffic for our SEO efforts.  I [found this article on long tail keywords](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/definition-long-tail-keyword-100-words-sr) to be the best explanation of the second point of this effort.

Once you have the result from the Keyword Explorer, you need to do the following:

1. Click on the All link under keyword ideas on the left.
2. Use the KD filter and set it from 0 to 30.

Your results should look something like this:

<img src="images/articles/writing-best-seo-post/keyword-ideas.jpg" alt="ahrefs Keyword Explorer example">

Make sure you are sorting by volume as well.  We want to be picking keywords that have the best SEO results with the lowest competition.  The KD metric is the [Keyword Difficulty](https://ahrefs.com/keyword-difficulty) factor.  The higher the number, the harder it is to rank SEO wise for that keyword.

For each main keyword you want to pick 1-2 keywords from the Keyword Explorer.  Be realistic in this part, you don't want to pick words that make no sense to your goals.  Once done, set those keywords aside as you will be incorporating these into the blog post during the writing phase of this effort.

**Site Explorer**

The [ahrefs Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer) is a very powerful tool that basically give you all the SEO metrics for a give URL.  We will be using it for the purpose of viewing the top ranking posts in regards to our main keywords phrases.

To begin do the following:

1. In Google put the title of your article in the search bar.
2. Make sure your ahrefs toolbar is turned on.
3. Grab the URLs of the top 5 results that have a Domain Rating of 50 or higher.
4. Take each one of the URLs and paste it into the Site Explorer.  Make sure you are setting the select list from prefix to URL only.
5. Under organic search on the left, click the Organic Keywords link.
6. Filter by a KD of 0-30 and make sure you are sorting by traffic.

Your results should come out like this:

<img src="images/articles/writing-best-seo-post/site-explorer-compressor.jpg" alt="ahrefs Site Explorer example">

As in our Keyword Explorer step, you want to find the keywords that have the biggest audience with the lowest competition.  The goal of these steps is to have around a dozen keyword phrases / long tail keywords that also contain your main keywords.  This way you can begin to craft your writing sample with metrics I will explain below.

Another tactic I use with the Site Explorer, is to use [ahrefs Content Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/content-explorer) as well.  Basically, just take your main keywords and keyword phrases and put them into the Content Explorer.  Grab the top three results for each and plug them back through the Site Explorer.  The same principle applies here as before.  This step usually gives us an extra keyword or two for our writing sample.

### Deeper Competitor Research

We have already looked at our competitors websites during our keyword research phase.  In this step, we are going to take some metrics from the top 10 keyword ranking competitors and analyze them.  We are looking for two main factors in this step, the word count and the number of external links.  These are both important ranking factors with any search engine.  The longer the post, the more chances there are to add keywords.  The more external links there are, the more authoritative the post appears.

Copy and paste [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x60USJde1vfHYWeM1kNkb02H06HjLGLHMKEyuhet8mU/edit#gid=0) I made for you. To begin put the main keyword phrase (I usually choose the blog post title) into Google and grab the top 10 results.

Ahrefs toolbar does not have an export feature unlike the Moz toolbar does.  So if you are using ahrefs, you will have to do this step manually.  However, usually you can install the Moz toolbar for free and grab the export via the button in the top left of the toolbar.  It is so much easier.  Grab the title and the URL of the top 10 domains and put them into the sheet.  I then go through and fill in all the Domain Ratings for each URL.  The DR in this step isn't that important, but it does give you an average of what your site may need to be to rank in the top 10.

**Word Count**

Now that we have the start of our spreadsheet we just need to grab the word count of each article.  Use [this Word Counter tool](https://wordcounter.net/website-word-count) to grab the word count for each writing sample in your top 10.  I usually throw out one or two results that are way higher or lower than the other results.  Now look at the average number.  That is the word count goal you need to hit with your writing sample.

**External Links**

This is a decent [external link counter](https://www.seoreviewtools.com/internal-link-analyzer/) that I use.  Again, go through and each URL in this website and put the result in the spreadsheet. The same as above, the average number of outbound links is what you want to hit when writing your blog post.

Writing
----------

The hard part is essentially over now.  You have done your research on what you need to write to get the best SEO blog post.  Now you just need to take the data from the previous steps and begin writing.

I generally try to follow these standards when writing the blog post:

1. Your main keywords should be used about 15+ times per blog post.
2. The keyword phrases can be included in the number above.
3. Try to exceed the average number of words and external link in your writing sample.

The rest just comes down to taking the time and writing the blog post.  I suggest just blasting through in initially and let the words flow out.  Keep in mind to utilize the keywords you planned out as well.  Take the extra long route when forming your sentences.  It is ok to add extra explanation to get that word count even higher.

Then once you have that first draft, go back through and add keywords where you can.  Make sure the ebb and flow of the words is logically.  Google is very smart and you don't want a SEO penalty from [keyword stuffing](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/03/21/dangers-of-keyword-stuffing).

While you are writing the blog post, I usually like to use this [tool for checking the word count](https://wordcounter.net/) as well.  This can give you a generally idea of where you are at during the process.

Once you feel comfortable with what you wrote, publish!

Conclusion
----------

It does take a few hours to come up with this best plan for writing a great SEO blog post.  However, once you get the knack down for it, you will be able to bang out long form, keyword saturated blog posts in no time.
