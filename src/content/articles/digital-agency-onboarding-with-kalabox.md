There's a common phrase heard throughout the web development community and feared by all in our office:

> Well...it worked on my machine.

Over the years my team and I have tried to settle on common web development tools that would allow us all to collaborate on digital products and minimize our headaches and redundant speach patterns. Local web development envirnoments were especially difficult to master. Even if we all installed MAMP, XAMP, Virtual Box, or installed native web server stacks, we could not gurantee we would were all working under the same development conditions and eventually one of us would wind up with the WSOD. Maybe it was RAM allocation, maybe it was MySQL tuning for large databases, maybe it was version of SASS was not the same as my co-workers. Then there was the dreaded moment of truth when pushing changes to our web hosting service. Or on the flip side of that coin; we download all the website code, assets and database from our web host only to spend the next half a day trying to get our website to load in our local web browser.

After exchanging 'my.conf' and 'php.ini' files over slack (yes - that just happended), we finally find solace. No more WSOD. We can finally begin slaying code like galdiators. All shall rejoice!

Now that was just for one team member. Everybody has their own stack preference, so be prepared to know that you will never be fully prepared.
