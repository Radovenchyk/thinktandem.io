Well, I’m almost caught up on sleep from this year’s [New England Drupal (NED) Camp](https://nedcamp.org/) held at Rhode Island College in Providence RI. With this year’s focus on [DevOps](https://thinktandem.io/services/devops/) some asked why someone who works in [Strategy](https://thinktandem.io/services/strategy/) and Project Mangement would be interested in this development centric camp. The answer is, that it’s all connected and to keep being able to speak not only to the end users needs but to that of my team, I need to try to take in as much as I can. And add to it that two of my [team members](https://thinktandem.io/about/) and many friends were going to be there - how could I have resisted?

Training Day! Critical Skills for the Modern Drupal Project Manager
-------
I was lucky enough to participate in this year's training day with a session taught by Matt O'Bryant, the Director of Strategy at Oomph, Inc. This was a fun, interactive session aimed at recognizing the professionalism each of us brought with us to the class to help us build upon each others expereinces. This included working together to better defne roles to help us see where the line is between Project Manager, Strategist and Account Manager, and who owns which responcibilties. We discussed how, in many agencies, roles are somewhat blended and how to navigate those waters. With multiple companies represented in the room, we learned from the best in each other. We moved onto tool we use and talked through some of the strengths and weakesses they offered. And then came the fun part! Role-playing. We acknowledged the challenging conversations we face and worked through them - analyzing what we felt worked and how we could have improved upon it. 

After lunch, we moved onto a more technical role. We spun up local environments of a website Matt had prepared for the class. Quickly, the challenges in that seemingly ‘easy’ task became clear: different operating systems, different dependencies etc, al made more obvious as there were not many developers in the room (though they stepped up to help!). Over the next few hours, we worked through many of the issues our dev team deals with regularly. After being out of development for years, well I know that I walked away with a renewed sense of empathy for my developers!

In the end, we summarized what we took from the session and gave constructive feedback to allow future attendees to benefit from the insights each of us was able to share.

<h3>Dinner and Singing</h3>
That evening many of us descended upon Cassarino's for fine Italian food and better conversation. We spoke of professional experiences, laughed as friends and enjoyed a variety of delicious food. Later there was karaoke with a handful of wonderful people; the highlights included drinking from porcelain cats, singing alongside a teammate and hearing the others give it their all! 


Session Day! All the learning!
-------

<h3>Intro to Lando</h3>
Well, of COURSE, I went to our own [Mike Pirog’s](https://twitter.com/pirogcommamike) session [“Intro to Lando.”](https://youtu.be/aryOE-lkoIo) An energetic speaker, our Mike filled the room with people who know or are just getting to know more about [Lando](https://docs.devwithlando.io/). I was able to observe not only Mike’s intense ability to share his knowledge but was also able to see how the different users in the audience were captivated. Asking questions, emulating the code on the board. Looking around nearly every laptop seemed to be pulled up to check and review what was on the board. While others were on their phones taking notes to look back later. A friend (and amazing developer) on the other side of the room was kind enough to answer a few questions for me. He simply said that it might be time for him to adopt Lando into his workflow. 

<h3>Team!</h3>
Like many remote teams, our group's everyday life is spent communicating in Slack and on video calls. Though I was fortunate enough to see my team members already this fall, I looked forward to spending more time together at NED Camp. We set aside some of our time together on Saturday talking about services and processes were well spent as we worked through questions to formulate actionable next steps. And then there was time for fun; talk of hobbies, families, and fun. 

<h3>Keynote</h3>
Though I teased an organizer or two that filling me up with pasta and putting this Project Strategist in a warm comfy room to hear about DevOps wasn’t exactly setting me up for success, BUT I did MORE than manage to stay awake though [Geerling’s keynote](https://youtu.be/qQGEovsGbJA). He spoke to how DevOps is about people. It’s about improving the product, sure. But it improves the product by improving the quality of life of those who perform the tasks. This is something I understand and, can relate back to my team in terms of how I understand our process and the vital importance of that process. 

<h3>React</h3>
I hung out in that comfy auditorium for Chris Well’s session where he discussed [Embedding a React app in a Drupal 8 site](https://youtu.be/yhoPqdxeM24). It was interesting to have him show us the code and ask us what game it was for: after a few moments it was obvious he was describing tic tac toe. From that basic groundwork, he built up his presentation to discuss a more complex solution he had developed. He encouraged questions and discussion and shared his takeaways from the experience. 

<h3>The Making of a PodCast</h3>
Throughout the afternoon I observed [Stephen Cross recording interviews for a podcast](https://player.fm/series/talking-drupal/talking-drupal-186-live-from-nedcamp). Instead of going to the final session I sat out there, working on a few things for [A11yTalks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC__nH6oZrFXcUevljYJKbsw), and listened. I heard people I’ve seen speak for years sit down and talk about their experiences, their companies and where they’re all headed together. Stephen interviewed and conversed with each guest. With a crowded room and my attention divided I only caught part of it but I look forward to hearing more of these clips from NED Camp.

<h3>The After Party</h3>
No Drupal camp would be complete without the afterparty. The college hosted us in a room in which we could chat with friends, meet new people, and nosh on a variety of hors-d'oeuvres. As the night progressed some hugged and waved goodbye as they left the camp, while others of us made plans to keep things going a bit longer. We headed to food and then to a speakeasy where the Twitter-renowned picture “The Last Supper of #NEDCamp2018” was taken; oh and for the record, I was on the phone giving more people directions to come to join us! We all talked till late in the night. Then final hugs were given, Ubers were called and we all returned to our respective dormitories for the night. 


NEDCamp 2018 Takeaways
-------
On the drive home the next morning I had the music up and the sun streaming in through my sunroof. I had a few hours to think through this camp’s experiences. 
<ul><li><strong>Team:</strong> I love spending time with team members - Stephanie and Mike are wonderful people to work and to play with!
</li><li><strong>Community:</strong> you’ve heard me go on before but, in short, these faces I only see a handful of times a year have become important faces to me
</li><li><strong>Technology:</strong> digital is about people - we make websites and applications FOR people. And well, I learned that DevOps is about people too… it’s about the people who make the resources for the rest of us out there. 
</li></ul>
Until next year NED Camp! And thank you.
