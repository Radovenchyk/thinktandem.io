Building great applications requires not only great code and great architecture, but also great business decisions about which features to invest in, and which features remove. While doing great design and strategy work up front to identify personas, coupled with ongoing user interviews can be quite helpful to understand the business problems you are trying to solve and how well you're doing, users can't always articulate how they use your application.

Screen real-estate is precious, and if certain links and/or features of your application aren't being used, it can be helpful to identify them, so you can either experiment with improving the presentation, or just remove them from the application if it turns out they aren't useful to the user.
