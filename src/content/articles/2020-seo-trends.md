byline: 3 big SEO changes you should keep on the lookout for in 2020 (and how to prepare for them).
date: 2019-12-12

As December falls upon us like an avenging god, it's hard to remember the huge changes we've seen over the course of 2019. To reflect, we collated the advice of prominent SEO experts like Neil Patel and Backlinko with data from our clients to show what SEO trends we can expect in 2020.

## 2020 SEO Trends:

### 1. Increase in No-Click Searches

During 2019 49% of searches on Google result in no click. That means that for half of ALL searches on Google, the searcher doesn't actually click on any of the results on the page!

Why? More people are getting their results directly from the search page, particularly from _rich snippet data_ powered by Schema.org JSON-LD metadata. See more on that below in our recommendations.

### 2. Organic Visitor Numbers Will Continue to Decline

Did your visitor numbers drop this year? You're not alone. Total visits from organic search dropped 6% YoY in Q2 2019. We expect this to continue, largely due to the above mentioned "no-click" results phenomenon. The growing sway of "closed garden" ecosystems will also accelerate this trend. If I'm looking for local events, I no longer search Google. I go directly to Facebook, Eventbrite, Meetup, LinkedIn, etc. This holds true for many ecommerce products (straight to Amazon), news searches (to my favorite publications' sites), and other resources.

And unfortunately mobile organic search has declined faster, a trend we think may accelerate. We believe that the platform effect is even stronger in mobile due to the intrinsic power of apps. Yes I have Chrome on my phone, but so much of my daily activity finding new content happens within curated app experiences.

### 3. Non-Organic Backlinking Continues to Fail

Over the past several years we've seen "backlinking", the process of curating links back to your content from other websites, grow as a service in the SEO industry. In the early days, fly-by-night operators of "blog networks" could create thousands of self-hosted sites and pepper them with backlinks back to your content to boost SERPs. Google quickly caught on to these tactics and is usually able to detect the "domain authority" of websites backlinking. Employing blog networks or other low quality backlinks is now, in the best case, a waste of money.

More recently, backlink providers like [The Hoth](https://www.thehoth.com/) have provided better quality backlinks, finding higher quality domains with content relevant to yours to place backlinks. While not cheap, these services are relatively inexpensive and _still can work_, particularly if you're trying to capture a relatively uncontested regional market.

However, in 2020 backlinking will become even more competitive as more of your competitors start using backlinking services like The Hoth and Google continues to refine how it assesses backlink quality. We believe site owners will need to strengthen their backlinking strategy with even more attention to their inhouse "organic" backlinking efforts and being more strategic in what pages they try to boost.

## How to Improve Your SEO in 2020

### 1. Target Intent Indicating Keywords

Have you ever searched to compare two major competitors? "Shopify vs. WooCommerce". "Advantages of Mautic over Salesforce". Keywords like "vs", "comparison", "advantages", and other indicate that someone is trying to compare services/products in the process of deciding what to buy.  In other words, these keywords indicate an _intent to buy_. These are the keywords that are worth optimizing SEO for!

Neil Patel recommends using his tool [Ubersuggest](https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest) to find these types of comparison keywords, and we like to track these keyword combos using the [Rank Tracker feature](https://ahrefs.com/rank-tracker) in Ahrefs.

### 2. Optimize for Rich Snippets

This means making sure the Schema Markup on your site is up-to-snuff. We love the JSON-LD powered Schema Markup; it's a huge improvement over the competing metadata standards that existed in the beginning of the 2010s. However, many site owners don't realize how Google uses the Schema Markup standards to create "Rich Snippets".

The [FAQ Schema Markup](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/faqpage) is one successful metadata type you can use to create Rich Snippet results for your articles in Google. That metadata produces the lists of frequently asked questions you might see below certain search results in Google. For example, here's an example from a current search for "examples of faq schema markup":

Look how this enriches the search result, providing more real estate and more clickable options for your hard won result! For a more broad overview of what Rich Snippets are and their advantages, see [this guide](https://mangools.com/blog/google-rich-snippets-guide/) with some Rich Snippet examples from Mangools.

### 3. Build an Inhouse Backlink Strategy

If you're not already conducting outreach to relevant influencers, now is the time to cultivate relationships with people who _want_ to backlink to your content. Tools like [BuzzStream](https://www.buzzstream.com/) can help you find and manage these relationships en masse, which is vital if you're going to scale efforts. But don't be too artificial! Find influencers who genuinely need your content, and make it as easy as possible for them to extract value from it. Think of what would benefit their audience first, then draw the line back to your content. Dedicate real time, ideally a few hours each week, to cultivating these relationships, strategizing on content, and conducting outreach to new influencers.
