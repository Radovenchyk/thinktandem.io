Continuous Integration (CI) methodologies and tools can deliver huge efficiency gains for web development teams. However, overburdened with feature requests and new projects, many development teams never have the time to learn and implement a CI workflow. Now is that time.

In this training, we provide hands-on instruction in how to setup a continuous integration workflow for your team using Github, TravisCI, and several popular hosting platforms (Pantheon and Platform.sh).

## Topics Covered

- What is Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment?
- The why and how of Gitflow.
- Overview of CI services.
- Using TravisCI.
- How to improve QA processes.
- Basic automated testing concepts.

## Who Should Attend
Although we encourage non-developers to attend, to participate in the hands-on portions of the training, you’ll need…

- A laptop with Git working
- A Github account
- Experience using basic Git commands
- A working code editor
- Basic knowledge of code syntax

Contact us if you need suggestions on resources to meet these prerequisites.

Non-technical stakeholders who are involved in day-to-day development process will gain a thorough understanding of how a CI workflow works and why one should be adopted, but they’ll get the most out of the training by attending with one or more of their development team.
