We've been working with Pantheon for over 6 years, using their service, building their <a href="./case-studies/pantheon-kalabox.md">local development platform</a>, and acting as an official training partner. As a result we know their product, platform and team better than most.

In our training sessions, we accelerate your team's Pantheon-powered development process by teaching...


* Pantheon basics
* Migrations
* Using New Relic with Pantheon
* Kalabox and Lando for Local Development
* Advanced DevOps: Using CircleCI, GitHub flow, Behat and Quicksilver
* Deep Developer Dives: Troubleshooting specific developer questions
* Pantheon Tips and Tricks

At the conclusion of the trainings and as reward for a group job well done we always made sure to reward everyone with a happy hour!
