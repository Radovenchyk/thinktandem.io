  - Can you walk me through the structure of two non-trivial Laravel projects you’ve deployed for customers?
  - Can you discuss different problem scenarios and how you would solve them with Laravel?
  - Have you created a new package for Laravel or made a significant fork of an available package?
  - Do you know how to setup a continuous integration pipeline for a Laravel project?

Basic Linux experience
  - Are you comfortable on the command line?
  - Have you set up your own Linux web server before?

#### Bonus Points

Beyond these basics, we’d love to find someone with experience or a very strong interest in one or more of the following:

- Other PHP frameworks like Symfony, Drupal, or WordPress
- NodeJS
- Docker
- Agile and Lean methodologies
