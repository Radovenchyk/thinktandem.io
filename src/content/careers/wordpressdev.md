1. Composer for dependency management.
2. Bootstrap 4 to create a responsive theme from a Sketch file (or similar design resource).
3. Twig templating (preferably via [Timber](https://www.upstatement.com/timber/)).
4. Custom plugins that you&#39;ve created.

We strongly prefer individuals who have experience with Drupal 8, Laravel or Symfony; our WordPress projects are organized around the technologies and principles that these frameworks use.

We&#39;d love to see examples of you working with...

1. Elementor page builder.
2. Vue.js or React
3. Lando for local development.
4. Drupal, Laravel, or Symfony experience.

- Located within 3hrs time window of Pacific Standard Time.
- Available for meeting 8AM-5PM PST. Much of our team is in EST and we have a mandatory daily standup at 8AM PST. East Coast team members tend to stop work ~2PM PST but make themselves available for West Coast client meetings when needed.

Please do not apply if you do not fit both of these criteria.

#### About Tandem

Do you want a place to work on your own ideas AND make money?

Back in 2012, Tandem founders Alec and Mike had a crazy idea: using the profits from their consultancy, they could avoid the venture-funded rat race and fund development of new digital products themselves.

Since then they not only created [insanely popular products](https://docs.devwithlando.io) and helped [great organizations](https://thinktandem.io/work), but learned the power of relationships. Trust. Transparency. Treating people like adults. These are the values that created the Tandem team and sustain it today.

So if you have that wild, Muir-like spirit within you, the one that wants to climb the entrepreneurial tree and scream out to the world, Tandem is making a place for you. It&#39;s a place that feeds the creative beast while respecting your need for a balanced life. Because let&#39;s face it, we&#39;re all too old for this &quot;ramen stage&quot; shit.


#### Interview Process

1. Initial interview to review basic qualifications and for both of us to gut-check the fit. (15 minutes)
2. Relevant code and devops tests (30 min - 1hr)
  1. Basic code test and pair programming to confirm base level core competency
  2. Walk us through two previous projects that demonstrate your experience with our WordPress requirements.
  3. Grabbing a documented issue in and of Tandem&#39;s (or Lando&#39;s) public repos and submitting a PR.
3. Reference checks
4. Followup interviews with the team. (30 min - 1hr)
5. Profiting together?
