### Job Description

Tandem is looking for a web project manager for a contract position on several upcoming projects. For web projects, we believe that project managers have three responsibilities:

-   Account Management: Supporting the relationship with the client.

-   Process Management: Making sure that each sprint is organized so the team has the resources it needs to do development with minimal confusion. Collect requirements so a technical architect can make them "shovel ready".

-   Detail Management: Meetings are scheduled, burndown charts are up-to-date. You catch so many small issues when QAing a website that your team is a little scared of you.

You are a project manager who excels in at least two of these categories and is transparent about your weaknesses in the third.

In order to succeed this individual should...

-   Share [Tandem's core values](https://docs.thinktandem.io/manifesto/).

-   Share the core thrusts of Tandem's engineering values.

-   <https://docs.devwithlando.io/contrib/vision.html>

-   <https://docs.thinktandem.io/guides/contributing-code.html>

-   Give a shit and take pride in their (and by extension) the organization's work.

-   Be self-motivated and passionate about learning.

-   Be pleasant to work with.

-   Be creative and allergic to dogma.

-   Be able to see the "big picture" value of your work.

### Essential Requirements

**Experience**

-   5+ years working in web development (could be as a PM, developer, or other role).

-   3+ years experience as a project manager.

-   Experience managing a fully remote team.

-   Experience managing a Drupal or WordPress project.

**Account Management**

-   Have you been the direct client contact for projects, reporting project progress and running meetings?

**Process Management**

-   Have you ran standups and managed issues in a sprint?

-   How do you know when a developer is struggling? Can you unblock them?

-   Have you used Github Flow to manage a project?

-   Are you familiar with agile and lean development concepts?

**Detail Management**

-   Have you consistently QAed a developer's work before?

-   How many clients have you managed simultaneously?

### Nice-to-Haves

-   Consultancy Experience: you've worked with clients external to the organization you belonged to.

-   Technical Background: past experience as a web developer.

-   CMS Knowledge: You have deep knowledge on how Drupal, WordPress, or another CMS works. You can speak with authority on the comparisons between various CMSs.

-   Custom Web Application Knowledge: You've managed a project building a complex custom web application using a framework like Laravel, Rails, etc.

### Location Requirements

Tandem is a completely remote team, but to apply you must be...

-   Located within 3hrs time window of Pacific Standard Time.

-   Available for meeting 8AM-5PM PST. Much of our team is in EST and we have a mandatory daily standup at 8AM PST. East Coast team members tend to stop work ~2PM PST but make themselves available for West Coast client meetings when needed.

Please do not apply if you do not fit both of these criteria.

### About Tandem

Do you want a place to work on your own ideas AND make money?

Back in 2012, Tandem founders Alec and Mike had a crazy idea: using the profits from their consultancy, they could avoid the venture-funded rat race and fund development of new digital products themselves.

Since then they not only created [insanely popular products](https://docs.devwithlando.io) and helped [great organizations](https://thinktandem.io/work), but learned the power of relationships. Trust. Transparency. Treating people like adults. These are the values that created the Tandem team and sustain it today.

So if you have that wild, Muir-like spirit within you, the one that wants to climb the entrepreneurial tree and scream out to the world, Tandem is making a place for you. It's a place that feeds the creative beast while respecting your need for a balanced life. Because let's face it, we're all too old for this "ramen stage" shit.
