#### You are...

* Self-motivated + passionate about learning
* Pleasant to work with
* Creative and allergic to dogma
* Committed to the career of a professional software developer.

We’re looking for junior applicants and prefer to hire for fit rather than skills. Working with us is a great way to replace or supplement a programming bootcamp or even a 4-year degree.

#### A sampling of the applicants we’ve hired in the past:

* A community college graduate looking to get practical web development experience
* A programmer re-entering the job force after several years absence
* A history undergraduate making the switch to a career in programming
* A developer making the transition from financial tech to web development

#### Basic Skills

While we’re open to a wide range of experience levels, some basic fundamentals are necessary. Specifically, you need experience with…

* Basic web application development
* Basic Linux and CLI experience

#### Bonus Points

Beyond these basics, we’d love to find someone with experience or a very strong interest in one or more of the following:

* Docker
* PHP frameworks like Symfony, Drupal, and Laravel
* NodeJS/Angular/React
* Agile and Lean methodologies

#### Location + Remote Options

We’re located in downtown San Francisco, but as a remote team we’re open to applicants who are located in a compatible time zone. You MUST be located within 3hrs time window of Pacific Standard AND available for meeting 10AM-5PM PST. Please do not apply if you do not fit both of these criteria.

#### Applying

Please send a resume and/or relevant experience/projects to <mailto:jobs@thinktandem.io>. We would also love for you to provide answers to the following:

* Can you describe your preferred web stack to me?
* Can you show me a code repo of a project you’ve completed with a popular web framework?
* Do you use Git for version control?
* Are you comfortable on the command line?
* Have you ever tried setting up your own Linux server? How’d it go?

**Please do not apply if you are an oursourcing agency! We are looking for individual applicants only.**
