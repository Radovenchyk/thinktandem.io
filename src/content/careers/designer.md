You are...

-   Self-motivated and passionate about learning.
-   Pleasant to work with.
-   Creative and allergic to dogma.
-   Experienced in design, but able to see the "big picture" value of your work.

Our ideal candidate is looking for a part-time position (contract OK) that would grow into a full-time position as soon as possible. Please, no firms...we want a sweating, breathing creative dynamo.

### Requirements

**Communicator-in-Chief:** People want to work with you, no matter whether they're your client, teammember, or barber. Must have had client-facing responsibilities in the past. References tell a thousand words.

**Web-Focused:** You've swum in the waters of web design for many moons and have a modern web design portfolio spanning a range of industries. This isn't a good position for print designers transitioning into digital design.

**Responsive Design:** All our projects must work across a wide-range of device widths. Show us how you communicate responsive behavior to development teams!

### Nice-to-haves

**Creative Leadership:** Experience leading teams of designers, copywriters, and strategists a plus. This position has the potential to turn into a creative director role.

**Atomic Design:** You think about how design is translated into development, and atomic design principles have been a guiding light.

**Front-end Implementation:** Experience creating HTML mockups (preferably with Bootstrap or another framework) or theming Drupal/WordPress sites is preferred.

**Accessibility:** Knowledge of WCAG accessibility standards and how they apply to design.

**App Design:** Proven experience designing mobile or desktop apps.

**UX Research:** Conducting UX research using heat maps, user testing results, and analytics data. Making UX recommendations based off this research.

### Location

Tandem is a completely remote team, but to apply you must be...

-   Located within 3hrs time window of Pacific Standard Time.

-   Available for meeting 8AM-5PM PST. Much of our team is in EST and we have a mandatory daily standup at 8AM PST. East Coast team members tend to stop work ~2PM PST but make themselves available for West Coast client meetings when needed.

Please do not apply if you do not fit both of these criteria.

### About Tandem

Do you want a place to work on your own ideas AND make money?

Back in 2012, Tandem founders Alec and Mike had a crazy idea: using the profits from their consultancy, they could avoid the venture-funded rat race and fund development of new digital products themselves.

Since then they not only created [insanely popular products](https://docs.devwithlando.io) and helped [great organizations](https://thinktandem.io/work), but learned the power of relationships. Trust. Transparency. Treating people like adults. These are the values that created the Tandem team and sustain it today.

So if you have that wild, Muir-like spirit within you, the one that wants to climb the entrepreneurial tree and scream out to the world, Tandem is making a place for you. It's a place that feeds the creative beast while respecting your need for a balanced life. Because let's face it, we're all too old for this "ramen stage" shit.
