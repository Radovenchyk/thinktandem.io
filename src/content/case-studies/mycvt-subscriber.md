> Trust is earned when actions meet words.

We're proud of all the projects we work on, but among all of our clients, California's Valued Trust (CVT) stands out. By developing the MyCVT enrollment portal, we helped tens of thousands of CVT subscribers (primarily teachers and school staff in K-12 education) find an easier way to enroll in their insurance.

- a standardized data model
- an easy way to generate and consume APIs
- automated report and simple interface generation.

We selected Drupal as a way to prototype the MyCVT system. With roots as a popular CMS, Drupal could easily reproduce the data model of CVT's paper enrollment forms. The powerful suite of API and report construction tools included with Drupal allowed the construction and deployment of the initial version of MyCVT within months.
