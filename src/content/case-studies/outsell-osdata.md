Outsell Inc. has maintained a large database of data, information and technology businesses for over twenty years. However, while the value of their insights had grown, Outsell’s ability to collect and maintain data was bottlenecked by a legacy data entry application.

Tandem proposed a new data entry application. Using Laravel’s powerful object relational mapping (ORM) layer, we could quickly adapt to Outsell’s custom data model and create a front-end for quickly adding and editing records to the database. Laravel’s extensive ecosystem of libraries made it easy to find the best tools to power search, advanced reporting, and other features.

Now Outsell is able to onboard large teams of data entry specialists to increase its ability to collect and maintain records. By conservative estimates, this could lead to records being added and updated 10x more frequently than with the old system. Outsell’s customers can expect even more detailed reports and greater self-service access to company records.
