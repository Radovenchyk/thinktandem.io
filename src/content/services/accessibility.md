Compliance with accessibility standards is no longer a "nice-to-have."  Universities and other institutions are now frequently receiving demands to make their sites accessible for all audiences or face very real legal repercussions.

Tandem recommends that every site be at least Section 508 compliant as well as WCAG A compliant. While this might seem like a daunting task, we've identified clear pathways to make all sites compliant.
