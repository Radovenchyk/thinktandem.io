Your brand defines who you are and allows you to stand out online, but can it do more? It should! Your branding has the power to be worked into the overall user experience of your digital echo-sphere to intensify your identity. Your user’s journey should be unique to your site and drive the conversions you’re looking for. Relying heavily on <a href="strategy">strategic research</a> and with <a href="development">an understanding of the technical requirements and limitations</a>, your wireframes, designs, icons and other collateral will keep your ROI at front-of-mind.

<h2>The Process </h2>
<ol>We start with usability. Wireframing allows your team to see the user journey as it’s being mapped out. This is a great time to check for the accessibility of requested features too!</ol>
<ol>Designing a site that is in-brand, accessible, and takes into account the anticipated functionality, all while being engaging can be a lot to ask of a design but that’s where you’ll go next! </ol>
<ol>Once you’re feeling confident that the mockups are in alignment with your vision we’ll start work on the fine-tuning: icons, edits, and function-specific design.</ol>
<ol>When you and your stakeholders are ready to approve the look and proposed user journey, it’s time for hand-off your designs to <a href="development">our development team</a> where we’ll create an interactive style guide that allows you to see your designs come to life.</ol>

By simplifying this process we can enhance your brand's digital presence, plan the optimal user journey and wrap it up into an inclusive design that embodies where form meets function. Not sure how this will work with your creative goals? <a href="../contact">Reach out to our team</a>.
